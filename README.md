# Life_Expectancy and Adult Mortality Analysis
## Introduction
Accurate assessment of demographic metrics is crucial to understand a wide range of social, economic , and public health issues that affect populations worldwide. Life expectancy is one of the most important such indicators used to get a snapshot of societyâ€™s overall health. Life expectancy is dependent on many factors, where adult mortality is found to be one of its major contributors by affecting different population groups.
This research project will test if there are differences in life expectancy and adult mortality from 2000 to 2015. Such analysis is crucial in monitoring internationally agreed development goals, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  In addition, it can be used as a starting point to perform similar analysis by incorporating other factors (such as Status, Schooling ,Gender, Income etc.) that influence life expectancy.

## Source of Data

Life Expectancy Dataset will be used for the project. The dataset consists of data for 193 countries from 2000 to 2015 that have 2893 rows and 22 columns, mainly focusing on development status information, immunization, mortality, social, and economic aspects of countries. This data has been collected from the WHO data and UN websites and made available to the public on Kaggle.com.

## Analysis objective

The analysis is aimed to test:
 If there is a difference in life expectancy in the years (2000-2005,2006-2010,2011-2015) and if this difference (if any) statistically important/significant.
If there is a difference in adult mortality expectancy in the years (2000-2005,2006-2010,2011-2015) and if this difference (if any) statistically important/significant.

## Methodology
Data cleansing, transformation (if needed), and data exploration will be made.
The data will be divided in two three categories by year as: 2000-2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2015.
Compliance of assumptions required to follow the appropriate test will be done. Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing , confidence interval calculations as well as visualizations will be carried out.
